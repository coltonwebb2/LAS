### Introduction

The Wyoming Survey & Analysis Center (WYSAC) at the University of
Wyoming (UW) was commissioned by the Wyoming Game and Fish Department
(WGFD) to conduct a survey to gather opinions of anglers in the Laramie
region. This survey allowed anglers a chance to have their voices heard
on a variety of topics related to general preferences as an angler as
well as experiences with Diamond Lake, Wheatland Reservoir #3, and
channel catfish in southeastern Wyoming. Results from this survey will
be utilized to guide future fisheries management decisions in the
Laramie Fish Management Region. Start and End Dates were Nov 2023 - Jan
2024.

### Methods

#### Questionnaire Development

The survey instrument was developed in coordination with WGFD. Once
questions were decided upon, the questionnaire was programmed for web
administration with Qualtrics, a leading platform for creating and
distributing web-based surveys.

<br>

#### Sampling Frame, Sample Design, and Sample Size

The population of interest for this survey was defined as all resident
angers with a resident fishing license (daily, annual, or lifetime)
active between January 1st, 2023, and October 11th, 2023, with a home
address listed in Albany, Carbon, Goshen, Laramie, or Platte counties
with an email address on file. Lifetime license holders included only
those license holders that carried fishing privileges and had a birth
date listed after January 1st, 1944. The population also included all
nonresident anglers holding an annual nonresident fishing license active
between January 1st, 2023, and October 11th, 2023, with an email address
on file. After the full list of license holders and applicants was
supplied by WGFD, it was "cleaned" for valid email addresses and
de-duplicated. The total population resulting from these efforts
included 39,903 individual hunters, of which 39,893 had valid email
addresses.

<br>

#### Mode of Data Collection

The online (or web) mode was the only option for completing the survey.
Each potential respondent was assigned a unique passcode for accessing
the survey. The passcode was entered manually upon reaching the login
page of the survey, or automatically by clicking a link directly from an
email invitation.

<br>

#### Survey Administration

Data collection began in November 2023 and closed in January of 2024.

The survey administration protocols included the following steps:

-   First, an invite was emailed to all individuals who had a valid
    email address. These email invitations explained the purpose and
    importance of the survey and solicited participation via a personal
    link. These individuals received email invitations only with the
    first email invite sent in November 2023. A second reminder email
    was sent one week after the first invite in November 2023, followed
    by a third email reminder at the end of November 2023, and a final
    reminder email was sent in December 2023.

<br>

#### Response Rates

By the close of data collection, a total of 6,652 "raw" survey responses
were recorded. During data cleaning, a total of 4,400 useable surveys
were obtained with a valid response rate of 11.0%. Frequency tables in
the next section of the report include only the 4,400 usable responses.
Raw survey responses were considered unusable for a number of possible
reasons, such that 1,484 indicated they did not want to continue with
the survey, 21 individuals viewed the entirety of the survey but did not
respond to any questions, and 747 individuals dropped off from
completing the survey early enough to render the survey data unusable.

<br>

#### Data Compilation and Analysis

I used R to obtain frequencies. The final version of this "LAS_Results"
will also have maps and figures in conjuction to the tables.

**Frequencies**

In the following tables, the percentage distributions and raw frequency
counts of responses to all questions on the survey are presented.
Questionnaire items are presented in the order they appeared on the
survey; question text is presented verbatim. For all questions, No
answer/Refused and Don't know/Not sure responses are excluded from the
valid percent calculations (where applicable). Questions excluded from
the frequency table listing are all open-ended text responses.

-   -99 = Skipped/No Answer (Saw question but did not answer)

-   NA = Did Not See/ Missing (Never saw the question)

<br>

### Fee Type

Total sample size is `r nrow(d)`

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

### State

Total sample size is `r nrow(d)`

-   TS is Tasmania, Australia

-   Rhode Island and Vermont are the only states not represented

- 107 folks live in WY and mapped in WY, but are "non-resident" based on having a NFA feetype. Just be aware that these folks will show up in WY on the map. 

- AK, HI, TS are not shown

## Section 1 - General Questions and Preferences {.tabset}

**Frequencies**

In the following tables, the percentage distributions and raw frequency
counts of responses to all questions on the survey are presented.
Questionnaire items are presented in the order they appeared on the
survey; question text is presented verbatim. For all questions, No
answer/Refused and Don't know/Not sure responses are excluded from the
valid percent calculations (where applicable). Questions excluded from
the frequency table listing are all open-ended text responses and a
question asking individuals if they would like to continue with the
survey (see the supplemental open-end response report 2401a for a
listing of all text entries).

-   -99 = Skipped/No Answer (Saw question but did not answer)

-   NA = Did Not See/ Missing (Never saw the question)

### License Type

<br>

##### **In 2023, did you fish with a resident (1) or non-resident license (2)?**

Total sample size is `r nrow(d)`

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# Change numbers to words
d <- d %>% 
      mutate(licensetype = case_when(licensetype == 1 ~ "Resident",
                                    licensetype == 2 ~ "Non-resident", 
                                    .default = as.character(licensetype)))


# Filter the valid from the -99 and NA's
valid <- d %>% filter(!licensetype == "-99" , !is.na(licensetype))
other <- d %>% filter(licensetype == "-99" | is.na(licensetype))


# Make Vaild Table

valid <- valid %>% 
          add_row("licensetype" = "Total", 
                  Frequency = sum(valid$Frequency),

                    'Valid Percent' = " ") 
other <- other %>% 
          add_row(licensetype = "Total", 
                  Frequency = nrow(d),
                  'Valid Percent' = " ")


# Join
tbl <- rbind(valid, other) %>% 
        rename(" " = licensetype)


# Plot
tbl %>% 
  kbl(align= c("l","c","c"),
      caption = "Q1: In 2023, did you fish with a resident or non-resident license?") %>% 
  kable_classic("striped", stripe_color = "F2F4F4",  html_font = "Times New Roman", full_width = F, position = "left") %>%

```

- This is different than the residency column created by the fee type. This is info provided by the angler which was sometimes different than what their fee type indicated. We used the residency column for the reminder of the survey, not this license type.

-   21 viewed the entirety of the survey but did not respond to any
    questions

-   747 individuals dropped off from completing the survey early enough
    to render the survey data unusable.

## Section 2 - Diamond Lake {.tabset}

**Frequencies**

In the following tables, the percentage distributions and raw frequency
counts of responses to all questions on the survey are presented.
Questionnaire items are presented in the order they appeared on the
survey; question text is presented verbatim. For all questions, No
answer/Refused and Don't know/Not sure responses are excluded from the
valid percent calculations (where applicable). Questions excluded from
the frequency table listing are all open-ended text responses and a
question asking individuals if they would like to continue with the
survey (see the supplemental open-end response report 2401a for a
listing of all text entries).

-   -99 = Skipped/No Answer (Saw question but did not answer)

-   NA = Did Not See/ Missing (Never saw the question)

## Section 3 - Wheatland Reservoir 3 {.tabset}

**Frequencies**

In the following tables, the percentage distributions and raw frequency
counts of responses to all questions on the survey are presented.
Questionnaire items are presented in the order they appeared on the
survey; question text is presented verbatim. For all questions, No
answer/Refused and Don't know/Not sure responses are excluded from the
valid percent calculations (where applicable). Questions excluded from
the frequency table listing are all open-ended text responses and a
question asking individuals if they would like to continue with the
survey (see the supplemental open-end response report 2401a for a
listing of all text entries).

-   -99 = Skipped/No Answer (Saw question but did not answer)

-   NA = Did Not See/ Missing (Never saw the question)

## Section 4 - Catfish {.tabset}

**Frequencies**

In the following tables, the percentage distributions and raw frequency
counts of responses to all questions on the survey are presented.
Questionnaire items are presented in the order they appeared on the
survey; question text is presented verbatim. For all questions, No
answer/Refused and Don't know/Not sure responses are excluded from the
valid percent calculations (where applicable). Questions excluded from
the frequency table listing are all open-ended text responses and a
question asking individuals if they would like to continue with the
survey (see the supplemental open-end response report 2401a for a
listing of all text entries).

-   -99 = Skipped/No Answer (Saw question but did not answer)

-   NA = Did Not See/ Missing (Never saw the question)

**The Channel Catfish fisheries in the Laramie Region are maintained
through stocking. Little is known about angler catch or angler desire to
have the opportunity to catch catfish.**

-   40 people answered None ("0" days) for fishing for catfish in the
    Laramie Region in last five years but still checked Greyrocks as
    have fished for catfish in past 5 years. I am sure this is the case
