## About

**Laramie Angler Survey - Recreate WYSAC Report**

Last updadted: 3/26/2024

Colt Webb

**Goals**: 

- 1) Use the original (unaltered) data that WYSAC used to make their report and recreate the report they did for us to check numbers. The purpose of using the original (unaltered data) is so that I can compare the numbers of my analysis to theirs. The numbers should line up since its the same data. That will allow me to feel confident in my code and then I can copy my code to the final markdown file but run it with the finalized cleaned data that I wrote to the geodatabase in part one of this script. 

- **This is using original data before it was cleaned and fixed in section one so that I can compare it directly to the on Jessica did.**

### Introduction

The Wyoming Survey & Analysis Center (WYSAC) at the University of Wyoming (UW) 
was commissioned by the Wyoming Game and Fish Department (WGFD) to conduct a 
survey to gather opinions of anglers in the Laramie region. This survey allowed anglers a 
chance to have their voices heard on a variety of topics related to general preferences as an
angler as well as experiences with Diamond Lake, Wheatland Reservoir #3, and channel 
catfish in southeastern Wyoming. Results from this survey will be utilized to guide future 
fisheries management decisions in the Laramie Fish Management Region. 

- Start and End Dates: Nov 2023 - Jan 2024

<br>

### Methods

#### Questionnaire Development

The survey instrument was developed in coordination with WGFD. Once questions were 
decided upon, the questionnaire was programmed for web administration with Qualtrics, a 
leading platform for creating and distributing web-based surveys.

<br>

#### Sampling Frame, Sample Design, and Sample Size

The population of interest for this survey was defined as all resident angers with a resident 
fishing license (daily, annual, or lifetime) active between January 1st, 2023, and October 11th, 
2023, with a home address listed in Albany, Carbon, Goshen, Laramie, or Platte counties 
with an email address on file. Lifetime license holders included only those license holders 
that carried fishing privileges and had a birth date listed after January 1st, 1944. The 
population also included all nonresident anglers holding an annual nonresident fishing 
license active between January 1st, 2023, and October 11th, 2023, with an email address on 
file. After the full list of license holders and applicants was supplied by WGFD, it was 
“cleaned” for valid email addresses and de-duplicated. The total population resulting from 
these efforts included 39,903 individual hunters, of which 39,893 had valid email addresses.

<br>

#### Mode of Data Collection

The online (or web) mode was the only option for completing the survey. Each potential 
respondent was assigned a unique passcode for accessing the survey. The passcode was 
entered manually upon reaching the login page of the survey, or automatically by clicking a 
link directly from an email invitation.

<br>

#### Survey Administration

Data collection began in November 2023 and closed in January of 2024. 

The survey administration protocols included the following steps:

- First, an invite was emailed to all individuals who had a valid email address. These 
email invitations explained the purpose and importance of the survey and solicited 
participation via a personal link. These individuals received email invitations only
with the first email invite sent in November 2023. A second reminder email was 
sent one week after the first invite in November 2023, followed by a third email 
reminder at the end of November 2023, and a final reminder email was sent in 
December 2023.

<br>

#### Response Rates

By the close of data collection, a total of 6,652 “raw” survey responses were recorded. During data 
cleaning, a total of 4,400 useable surveys were obtained with a valid response rate of 11.0%. 
Frequency tables in the next section of the report include only the 4,400 usable responses. Raw 
survey responses were considered unusable for a number of possible reasons, such that 1,484 
indicated they did not want to continue with the survey, 21 individuals viewed the entirety of the 
survey but did not respond to any questions, and 747 individuals dropped off from completing the 
survey early enough to render the survey data unusable. 

<br>

#### Data Compilation and Analysis

I used R to obtain frequencies. The final version of this "LAS_Results" will also have maps and figures in conjuction to the tables.

**Frequencies**

In the following tables, the percentage distributions and raw frequency counts of responses to all 
questions on the survey are presented. Questionnaire items are presented in the order they appeared 
on the survey; question text is presented verbatim. For all questions, No answer/Refused and Don’t 
know/Not sure responses are excluded from the valid percent calculations (where applicable).
Questions excluded from the frequency table listing are all open-ended text responses and a question 
asking individuals if they would like to continue with the survey (see the supplemental open-end 
response report 2401a for a listing of all text entries).

- -99 = Skipped/No Answer (Saw question but did not answer)

- NA = Did Not See/ Missing (Never saw the question)

##### **In 2023, did you fish with a resident (1) or non-resident license (2)?**

Total sample size is `r nrow(d)`

### Question 2

<br>

##### **Would you like to continue this survey about fishing in the Laramie Region?**

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# Change numbers to words
d <- d %>% 
      mutate(Section1Q2 = case_when(Section1Q2 == 1 ~ "Yes",

# Filter the valid from the -99 and NA's
valid <- d %>% filter(!Section1Q2 == "-99" , !is.na(Section1Q2))

```

**Of the 6,652 "raw" survey responses:**

- 1,484 indicated they did not want to continue with the survey

- 21 viewed the entirety of the survey but did not respond to any questions

- 747 individuals dropped off from completing the survey early enough to render the survey data unusable.


### Question 3
